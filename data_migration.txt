Database Migration on premises to cloud migration !!
purpose of database migration ?
the scenario of this task is to shift or add on premises database into newly configured
cloud database i.e RDS(AWS service)

for this migration we need to hit a command to extract data from our premises database server
the command is

mysqldump -u root -h localhost -p1234 studentapp>centosdata2.sql

here you have data entries and database with schema in centosdata2.sql file

now we have all the database dump 

but the main concern rises is how to transfer this data into our newly formed database or instance ?
1st choice is to ping our local system powershell and local centos machine

then hit following command which will get us all the data from local centos machine
mind you your powershell and bash shell should be in network (ping)
scp -r root@192.168.0.3:/id_rsa C:\Users\Anup\Desktop
scp -r root@ipofcentosserver:/filename destinationofwindowsserver

other way is 
connect our centos m/c using moba extreme client (password based ssh)
just put our centos m/c public ip into moba extreme
then mind you you need to upload aws instance's ssh key into our centos m/c using mobaextreme

now you have privatekey of aws instance ,
always give 600 permission of your instance key since it doesnt allow your other users acess,
chmod 600 privatekey.pen

then hit following command which will transfer data to ec2 instance

scp -i deletekey.pem centosentry1.sql centosentry2.sql  ec2-user@65.0.105.137:/home/ec2-user/


now you have database and dump as well
now in the apache's conf file > context.xml file
   <Resource name="jdbc/TestDB" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
        maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
        username="admin" password="12345678" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        url="jdbc:mysql://database-1.cz80mgqccd5x.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/studentapp"/>

here in username - give the name assigned to db
password - 12345678 (assigned to rds)
then in db:endpoint - give rds databases endpoint in this place
save context.xml and start catalina and mariadb once


just login into our rds database
mysql -h database-1.cz80mgqccd5x.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com  -u admin -p12345678

and just
CREATE DATABASE studentapp;

note - do not add table into out studentapp database , it will be automatically created once we dump our on premises data with schema into rds database.

hit this command and your db will be dumped into rds and you will be able to view all the all the data that was on premises into your cloud rds.
 
mysql -u admin -h database-1.cz80mgqccd5x.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com  -p12345678 studentapp < /home/ec2-user/centosentry2.sql

syntax
mysql -u admin -h endpointRDS -p12345678 databasename < location-of-our-.sqldata-dump

Note - once you create RDS kindly ensure you have attached your instance to your rds

RDS migration 
dump file 
dum.sql  pushed on ec2 instance >> 

mysql -h rdsendpoint -u username -p12345678    <<  dbname

always give 600 permission of your instance key since it doesnt allow your other users acess

mysqldump -u root -h localhost -p1234 studentapp>centosdata2.sql

scp -i deletekey.pem centosentry1.sql centosentry2.sql  ec2-user@65.0.105.137:/home/ec2-user/


mysql -u admin -h database-1.cz80mgqccd5x.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com  -p12345678 studentapp < /home/ec2-user/centosentry2.sql
